 first we will connect the 2 LEDs with PB2 and PB3 of  PORTB of the microcontroller. A push button switch is then attached to PB0 pin and pulled-up using a 10K resistor. The remaining terminal of the switch is grounded. The function of a pull-up resistor is to insure that while leaving the switch as not pressed, the status of the PB0 pin should remain high. There are 20K pull-up resistors built into the ATmega chip that can be accessed from software also. But here  we are using an external pull-up circuit. When the switch is pressed, the two LEDâ€™s will glow and will turn off while we release the switch. This is how the circuit will work.
